    <h1>FIRST STOP: SULZBERG</h1>

    <h6 class="text-secondary">1 October 2018</h6>

    <p>Few months ago we moved to Raubling, at the foot of the Alps. Why? For the mountains. I lived two and a half
        years in a city between Frankfurt and Darmstadt where the terrain around was just flat. If you look at the map
        below you can see some hills in the north-west of Frankfurt, south-east of Darmstadt. But nothing in between. As
        I came from Brașov where I was doing trail running in the mountains, I couldn’t get used to what the new city
        was offering me. So I started to run less…</p>

    <p>I am pretty lucky that my husband is such an open-minded person who likes to try new things and make new
        experiences. He was a road runner before we met. But after some runs in the nature, on the trails, he learned
        how much beautiful this is. And the whole experience when running in the mountains – it’s just on a different
        level than running on the flat. At least for us :).</p>

    <p>So we decided that we won’t let the life pass by and when getting old to regret that we never had the courage to
        move there where our heart is – in the mountains.</p>

    <p>Moving to Raubling took us <strong>months</strong>. Maybe I’ll share at some other point in time the story of how
        we choose this village from all the other ones that are at the foot of the German Alps and why it took us that
        long. Raubling was not a coincidence, it was well calculated.</p>

    <p>In the month of moving house we didn’t run at all, we had a lot of work to do. In Germany you usually don’t get a
        furnished apartment, but an empty one and when moving, you need to move all your things: the wardrobe, the bed,
        the couch, the living-room furniture, the shoe cabinets, and sometimes even the kitchen furniture and
        appliances! We got support for the actual move of the things, but we had to renovate the new apartment
        first.</p>

    <p>So having run only 211 km for the first half of the year is actually just a bit more than nothing. Having 27 km
        run the whole May and nothing in June, I knew that I have to take it easy when starting running again.</p>

    <p>To take it easy, but keeping one goal in mind. An ultra-marathon in 2019. Why? Because I miss that. An ultra
        needs a strategy. And passion for running. I actually never ran an ultra alone, it always happened that I
        registered for an ultra to the races where only teams were accepted. And I always had great friends that were
        that crazy to do this together with me :).</p>

    <p>After the break in June I started with a 4,54 km run. Pace 6:16. That’s short and slow. But that was my
        condition, and I was not surprised considering how much I run in the previous months. I was also not
        discouraged. I knew that all I need to do to become better is to run maybe around every second day and to not
        increase the total distance with more than few km from one week to the next one. Only this way I can avoid
        getting injured.</p>

    <p>As there is still a lot of training needed to get back to the ultra-marathon distances, I find it good to set
        some intermediate goals. For a couple of weeks I have the first intermediate goal set: running from home to the
        peak of Sulzberg and back.</p>

    <p>On 17th of September I managed to get to the base of the mountain. Today, on 30th of September, I ran further and
        reached Schwarzlack and Kogl. I am already curious when I will reach the peak of Sulzberg and what will be the
        next intermediate goal.</p>

    <p>I am also very interested in some nice races that take place this year in this area of the Alps, so if someone
        around here has some ideas, I would be very interested to hear about them.</p>

    <p>See you on the trails!</p>

    <p><em>Later edit:</em> From home to the peak of Sulzberg I ran on March 3rd, 2019.
        The ultramarathon I ran it on June 15th, 2019 - Koasa Marsch - 55.41 km with 3,319 m and I managed the 4th
        place at open woman.</p>
