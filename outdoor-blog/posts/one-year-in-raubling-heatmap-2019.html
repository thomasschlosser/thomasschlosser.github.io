    <h1>ONE YEAR IN RAUBLING - HEATMAP</h1>

    <h6 class="text-secondary">29 July 2019</h6>

    <p>One year has passed since we moved to Raubling. Weâ€™re very happy with our decision. There were many aspects that
        we considered when choosing where to move and Raubling was the place which matched the most.</p>

    <p>Weâ€™ve done quite some activities in the area, so here a snapshot of the heatmap one year after the move (the
        orange lines to Rosenheim represent my commutes by bike to the German courses):</p>

        <div id="image1div" imageLocation="one-year-in-raubling-heatmap-2019/Heatmap-201907.png"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Weâ€™ve mainly been in the <em>Bayerische Voralpen</em>, <em>Chiemgauer Alpen</em> and
        <em>Kaisergebirge</em>.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™ve also been a bit in <em>Glocknergruppe</em> and <em>Salzburger Schieferalpen</em>, but those were some very
        short hikes, done while there was still snow. Iâ€™ll put though a screenshot below, as they cannot be seen in the
        one above.</p>

        <div id="image2div" imageLocation="one-year-in-raubling-heatmap-2019/Heatmap-201907-partial.png"
             type="long"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Besides that, weâ€™ve also done a canoe tour on Isar, from Lenggries to Bad TÃ¶lz. Isar is the river where actually
        the canoe sport took life.</p>
    <p>Another thing that I wanted to do again is ultra-marathons. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™ve done in the Kaisergebirge: we
        run at <em>Koasa Marsch</em> 55 km with ~3400 m elevation. With my time of 9h 40m I also managed the 4th place
        at open women. It was my first ultra where I didnâ€™t run in a team. In all the ultras ran in Romania I had the
        nice experience to run in a team with a friend.</p>
    <p>So we started with the mountains that are very close to us and after one year, if we take the car and drive half
        an hour, there are still tens, if not hundreds, of peaks that are waiting to be explored!</p>
    <p>And not only that, but there is such a wide range of outdoor activities that can be done! Thomas, who was afraid
        of heights, was also
        paragliding last year! Well, that was because he received it as a birthday gift, but still! ðŸ˜€</p>
